\title{background fitting via penalized least squares algorithm}
\description{
   intelligent background-correction algorithm is developed, which simulates manual background-correction procedure of an expert intelligently. It basically consists of works of three aspects: 1) the accurate peak position detection of Raman spectrum by continuous wavelet transform (CWT) with the Mexican Hat wavelet as the mother wavelet; 2) peak widths estimation by enhanced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) derivative calculation based on CWT but with the Haar wavelet as the mother wavelet; and 3) background fitting using penalized least squares with binary masks.

\usage{
baselineCorrectionCWT(x,peakWidth,threshold=0.5,lambda=100)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{ Raman spectrum }
  \item{peakWidth}{ returned by \code{\link{widthEstimationCWT}} }
  \item{threshold}{ the user define peak shape threshold }
  \item{lambda}{lambda is an adjustable parameter, it can be adjusted by user. The larger lambda is,  the smoother fitted background will be }
  \item{differences}{ an integer indicating the order of the difference of penalties of Whittaker Smoother method, see \code{\link{WhittakerSmooth}}}
}

\value{
  the final background
